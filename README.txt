AE Module Documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AE Connect is a free Drupal module that allows users to register and login to your Drupal website with their preferred social accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. They can also use their email and password.

Benefits provided by AE Connect:

    1. Increases your registration rate, as many users are reluctant to fill out big forms to get access. Using AE Connect, they can register with one click.
    2. Simplified register/login process.
    3. Easy integration with existing registration.

How to setup AE Connect?

    1. After you have installed AE-Connect, go to Configuration>System>AE Configuration.
    2. Enter your AE instance and the API key which you received after registering with AE.
    3. Under General>Social, choose the different social networks you would like to have on your signup widget.
    4. Itâ€™s possible to customize your AE-Connect widget. Use different settings under General, Widget, and Performance to do this. AE-connect uses default values if you skip this step.
    5. Start using AE-Connect.
